What should it do:
 - Define an arbitrary pipeline
    - This pipeline will have set functions that can be farmed out to containers
    - Pipelines should be hard typed
    - Pipelines should be able to cycle
 - Have that pipeline kicked off by a message queue
    - This pipeline should be run in it's own container
    - Should have built in logging
    - Should have on tracking of child containers
 - All pipelines then monitored by an overseer
    - This overseer needs to monitor running pipelines
    - needs to be stateless or backed by a state store
    - needs to have good error and fail over management of pipelines
    - needs to be able to retry pipelines

Farmed containers
 - Should be reusable by the same pipeline
 - Should be very fast to start up
 - Could have reused objects such as connections? (Could have security implications)

Start with just pipelines, don't bother with streaming or batch data
 - treat all as batches, either large or small
